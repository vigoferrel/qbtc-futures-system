## 📏 **Code Standards**

### **TypeScript Best Practices**
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Quantum interface example
interface QuantumState {
  readonly coherence: number;
  readonly entanglement: number;
  readonly consciousness: number;
  readonly timestamp: number;
}

export const calculateQuantumLeverage = (
  state: QuantumState,
  baseleverage: number
): number => {
  return baseleverage * state.coherence * state.entanglement;
};

// ❌ Bad - Untyped quantum calculation
const calculateLeverage = (state: any, leverage: any) => {
  return leverage * state.coherence * state.entanglement;
};
```

### **React Components (Quantum UI)**
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Quantum dashboard component
interface QuantumDashboardProps {
  readonly quantumState: QuantumState;
  readonly onCoherenceUpdate?: (coherence: number) => void;
  readonly isLicenseValid?: boolean;
}

export const QuantumDashboard: React.FC<QuantumDashboardProps> = ({ 
  quantumState, 
  onCoherenceUpdate,
  isLicenseValid = false
}) => {
  const [localCoherence, setLocalCoherence] = useState(quantumState.coherence);
  
  return (
    <div className="quantum-dashboard">
      <QuantumMeter 
        value={localCoherence}
        max={1.0}
        label="Quantum Coherence"
        licensed={isLicenseValid}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Custom Hooks (Trading Logic)**
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Custom hook for quantum trading
interface UseQuantumTradingOptions {
  readonly symbol: string;
  readonly maxLeverage: number;
  readonly licenseKey: string;
}

interface UseQuantumTradingReturn {
  readonly currentLeverage: number;
  readonly quantumState: QuantumState;
  readonly isTrading: boolean;
  readonly error: string | null;
  readonly executeTrade: (amount: number) => Promise<void>;
}

export const useQuantumTrading = ({
  symbol,
  maxLeverage,
  licenseKey
}: UseQuantumTradingOptions): UseQuantumTradingReturn => {
  // Implementation with license validation
  const [licenseValid, setLicenseValid] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    validateLicense(licenseKey).then(setLicenseValid);
  }, [licenseKey]);
  
  // ... rest of implementation
};
```

### **File Organization**
```typescript
// Import order for QBTC components
import React from 'react';                          // React core
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';       // React hooks
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';             // Third party
import { QuantumButton } from '@/components/ui';    // QBTC UI components
import { useQuantumState } from '@/contexts';       // QBTC contexts
import { QuantumState } from '@/types';             // QBTC types
import { quantumLogger } from '@/core/logging';     // QBTC core systems
import { validateLicense } from '@/lib/license';    // QBTC utilities

// Order within the file
// 1. Interfaces/Types
// 2. Constants (including license-related)
// 3. Main component
// 4. Sub-components (if any)
// 5. Default export
```

### **Testing Standards**
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Quantum system tests
describe('QuantumLeverageEngine', () => {
  const mockLicenseKey = 'valid-test-license-key';
  const mockQuantumState = {
    coherence: 0.85,
    entanglement: 0.72,
    consciousness: 0.91,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };

  beforeEach(() => {
    vi.clearAllMocks();
    mockLicenseValidation(true);
  });

  it('should calculate optimal leverage with valid license', () => {
    const engine = new QuantumLeverageEngine(mockLicenseKey);
    const leverage = engine.calculateOptimal(mockQuantumState, 100);
    
    expect(leverage).toBeGreaterThan(50);
    expect(leverage).toBeLessThanOrEqual(125);
  });

  it('should reject operation with invalid license', () => {
    mockLicenseValidation(false);
    const engine = new QuantumLeverageEngine('invalid-key');
    
    expect(() => {
      engine.calculateOptimal(mockQuantumState, 100);
    }).toThrow('Invalid or expired license');
  });
});
```
